            <p>
                I have been interested in press and media since I was in college. My first internship was at Sony
                Pictures, in the marketing department, managing public relations. I then worked as a reporter in a
                news
                agency and my first full-time job was an editorial position at a local newspaper. Before I actually
                started working, I was more interested in reporting and catching the stories. However, after I
                became an
                editor, I discovered a whole new world and fell in love with the work.</p>
            <p>
                First, the biggest factor that made me feel like I was doing something special was creating a new
                journal everyday that would reach our subscribers with fresh information and new ideas. It was a
                privileged channel of communication, and being able to reach that many people everyday gave me a
                sense
                of pride and responsibility in my work. Also, to deliver the latest news on Monday, I had to go to
                work
                and prepare the journal on Sunday, which made me feel like I was living one beat ahead of the world,
                still waiting patiently for the news to break out.</p>

            <p>
                Newspaper companies had a very rigid atmosphere, similar to the product they were making. It was a
                world
                full of rules. From numerical notation to minor grammatical choices, everything had to follow the
                journal standard. In particular, the journalâ€™s layout was the strictest part. For example, our
                newspaper
                is supposed to have six columns, and to give stability it could either be balanced as 4-and-2 or
                3-and-3. Also, nine articles had to be introduced per page, no matter their lengths. Or no more than
                three images should be used, following specific sizes, and ensuring they picture different
                themes.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, these rules were suffocating but, as I got used to it, it turned into a game. A frame in
                which
                I could exercise my creativity while still delivering a high quality product. It was thrilling.</p>
            <p>

                Once I got comfortable creating layouts, the next obstacle was writing headlines and subheads. They
                determine the value of the news and if people will be interested. The headline grabs the attention
                and
                the subhead quickly delivers the essential message.</p>
            <p>
                Building newspapers everyday carried the same tension and excitement as dancing tango with the
                people
                waiting to hear from me everyday. I had a duty to inform and very strict rules to follow, but I
                danced
                within that frame and found a way to express my own creativity. Through this experience, I learned
                how
                to become an interesting storyteller and build stable yet interesting layouts.
