                Throughout my career, I held various titles such as content marketer or brand manager. By taking
                advantage
                of my long stay in Japan, I could work to implant diverse Korean products, such as sportswear, service,
                and
                applications, in the Japanese market. Among those experiences, working for “MindCafe” made me think
                really
                deeply about the true meaning of “service” and responsible advertisement.
            </p>
            <p>
                In East Asia, psychiatric counseling is taboo due to the conservative social climate. As social
                expectations
                are higher and fiercer than anywhere else, many people fall through the cracks of the system or hide
                themselves and do not receive the mental help they direly need.
            </p>
            <p>
                The service “MindCafe” provides non-face-to-face professional support to people in need of psychiatric
                counseling and treatment. It first started as an online community where people could open their minds
                and
                talk about their feelings and then it started to provide professional help to those in need. The service
                started in South Korea and planned to expand to Japan, recognizing the same symptoms and need for
                discreet
                and comfortable professional psychiatric support. I joined at the start of this project, bringing my
                professional skills but also my deep understanding of Japanese society.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working for MindCafe made me want to learn more deeply about visual and communication. Marketing was
                essential to reach more people and help them, but the message I wanted to convey was too abstract to
                attract
                people’s attention. I had no choice but to use stimulating images and strong catchphrases that would win
                people’s clicks, but I did not think these intense stimulations matched the service we provided.

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; font-style: italic; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
            “I am lonely but there is no one to open up to.”<br>
            “The feeling that I cannot tell my family.”<br>
            “I make mistakes one after another. Adult ADHD?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Using such phrases that amplify people’s insecurity and anxiety increased the number of users on the
            platform, but it felt like it was achieved by feeding their fears. While I continued to aggressively expand
            this marketing campaign, I tried to bring balance by building brand content more in line with the true
            values of Mind Cafe. Such content was kinder, not triggering, and more supportive and patient. But the
            contrast between the aggressive marketing campaigns and the positive branding content continued to grow. It
            gave me an eerie and uneasy feeling, and it felt that I was doing none of them right.
        </p>
        <p>
            This experience made me think about conscious marketing and how we can reach people in a healthy way, rather
            than resorting to violent and loud messages to get quick short-term engagement.
