                    Since XXX, I started the pre-master programme at Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE).
                    Through the course, I was able to learn DAE's tone and manner.
                    In that short time, I was exposed to new, authentic, design approaches and experienced many
                    materials and methodologies.
                    Based on that experience I produced an installation art, making "my private garden".
                    I expressed the exciting yet tense DAE pre-master experience as a garden, and thought about the
                    meaning of this course to me.

                    During that short period of time, I produced an installation combining various materials and

                    There is nothing on my own since I moved to Netherlands.
                    Then I stardted pre master and it becm myfirs offcial schedule.
                    I icked up more conscious habits (doing by my choice) since I moved in Europe
                    I had to make new choices in daily life such as picking the shampoo, go-for snack, etc.
                    To track down my choices I collected most of the containers from daily life trash.
                    Since I have more time now vs when I was employed I started to grow plant, picking the dead leaves, turning th pot,

                    My life in Europe began as a jobless couch potato. Since I immigrated to the Netherlands due to
                    marriage, my career went sideways and I did not have anything I could call my own when I arrived.
                    Then I started the pre-master programme, and it became my first official schedule.
                    After coming to Europe, I built more conscious habits. I had to constantly make new choices in my
                    daily life, such as picking my shampoo or go-for snack. To track down my choices, I collected most
                    of the
                    containers from daily products, like a hamster.
                    Also, since I had more time now compared to when I was employed, I started to grow plants, filling
                    up my time by caring for them: picking up the dead leaves and moving the pots according to the sun's
                    motion.

                    All of these new habits were unconsciously a defense mechanism to calm me down in this new chaotic
                    environment.
