                <span class="keypoint">Trigger:</span>
                After entering university in Japan, I felt strange on a very bright morning. Since it was my first time
                living abroad, I did not have the chance to be conscious of the time difference.
                Since Korea has a history of invasions and wars, even the time to enjoy the sun has been controlled
                according to the needs and ideology of neighboring countries. This time difference persists to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="keypoint">Solution:</span>
                Whenever I felt anxious while living abroad alone at a young age,
                I ironically found out that it was the 'light' that relieved my tension.
                I made a video of such moments of gratitude.

                    it
                    feels like Japan has longer
                    days than Korea. It is something I experienced living there
                    for
                    over
                    8 years. However, when sharing my experience, people cannot believe it to be true, stating that
                    Japan
                    and Korea
                    are close and share the same time zone.
                </p>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">

                    Latitude of Korea: 127.5°<br>
                    Latitude of Japan: 135°<br>

                Therefore, it would be normal for Korea and Japan to have a 30 minutes time difference. Korean
                timezone
                varied quite a lot over the course of history. In particular In 1912, due to the Japanese colonial
                occupation
                of Korea, standard time was adjusted to match Japanese time. This was reversed in 1954, 9 years
                after
                Korea
                independence, but moved again in 1961. This was a strategic decision made by the US to operate more
                conveniently in
                the area.
                Therefore, even something as pure as the sun rising in the morning is heavy from the weight of
                history
                and Korean morning are darker than they should be.

                I was living in Japan and could enjoy warmth and comfort from the morning sun, but I also felt
                uncomfortable
                thinking about history. Nevertheless, I captured the moment I felt grateful for the light and turned
                it
                in a
                video collage.
