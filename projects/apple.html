        What images come to people's mind when they think of apple? I like apple a lot. I like it not because of its
        taste, but because it has a playful shape and various symbolism such as jealousy, beauty, and original sin.
        As a result, there are many objects with apple motifs in our daily lives, but each color is subtly different.
        If you ask people, everyone will answer 'red', but the shades are all different. Not only that, apples have
        various sides,
        such as red and blue, and the changes are unique and subtle.
        I tried to express that charm in a kitschy way in an interactive form.
