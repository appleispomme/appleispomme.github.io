                            after the local government marked the area for urban development and people deserted the

                            now its

                    The history of Soje-dong traces back to the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945). At the time,
                    an important
                    railroad connected the granaries of Gunsan to Seoul, and Soje-dong was created in the middle of it
                    to be the
                    official management office/town. The area was previously occupied by a beautiful lake, “Sojeho lake”
                    (소제호),
                    filled
                    by the Japanese army. The village developed into a prosperous area where many Japanese-style houses
                    were built
                    as
                    the neighborhood grew. However, after the end of the Japanese colonial occupation, many of these
                    houses were
                    left
                    unattended, labelled of “Jeoksan houses” (적산가옥), negative heritage, and seen as a reminder of a
                    painful time. As
                    such, the rich village, where the Japanese army once lived, turned into an area where people were
                    reluctant to
                    live
                    in. The local government announced a plan to rebuild the entire neighborhood and people left one by
                    one. The
                    development plan never happened and the area turned into a slum.

                    For some, it is just a neighborhood, but I am personally connected to it. It is the place where my
                    father had to
                    work from the young age of 14, due to poverty. He still hates that area. But to me, as a 20-year-old
                    with a
                    passion
                    for photography, Soje-dong was a diamond in the rough, and, despite my father’s disapproval, I
                    visited it three
                    times a week.

                    The Daejeon city government made various attempts to revigorate the neighborhood, such as offering
                    artist
                    residencies, commissioning mural paintings, and trying to turn it into an attractive cultural
                    neighborhood. All
                    the
                    attempts failed, and urban redevelopment threatened once more the old village.
                </p>

                    I did not want to let this town disappear. It was where I practiced photography since the first time
                    I held a
                    camera
                    and the place that made me understand my usually silent father. I could not let this neighborhood be
                    forgotten,
                    and
                    that is why I started this project.

                    I met with a startup CEO, who held local marketing events, and shared my ideas with him on how to
                    show the true
                    value of Soje-dong. In collaboration with an event company, I designed a Silent Tour to promote the
                    area. I
                    would
                    guide people wearing headphones, telling them the history of the village, opening up about my
                    father’s story,
                    playing nostalgic music, and reading poetry, while showing them all the secret views and hidden gems
                    of
                    Soje-dong. I
                    became the docent and guardian of this old neighborhood.

                    We walked these streets where you can feel the weight of time and captured these anachronic moments
                    with my film
                    camera. At the end of the tour, I would lead them to a local café located in an old bed and
                    breakfast from the
                    Japanese colonial time, reflecting on the experience and the new perspective on the neighborhood.

                    These days, with the resurgent interest in vintage and retro-aesthetic, many turned their attention
                    toward
                    Soje-dong
                    and what was left of its historical buildings. Unfortunately, this attention is superficial and
                    buildings have
                    been
                    indiscriminately turned into cafés and gifts shops without care, damaging the buildings with
                    condensation and
                    mold.
                    This newfound interest is propelled by private companies, not grass-root or local movements, pushing
                    for
                    gentrification and short term-profit. Therefore, the neighborhood is endangered once again, as it is
                    getting
                    squeezed of its value, and may turn back into a slum as trendy cafés already starts to closes as
                    fast as they
                    opened.

                    Soje-dong survives on a fine balance. From a complicated history, to governmental mismanagement and
                    damaging
                    attention due to trends, how can we protect this neighborhood and coexist with the community?
