                    <span class="keypoint">Trigger:</span>
                    Due to real estate speculation and the tendency of
                    Koreans to prefer new things, it is confirmed that the entire
                    village, which contains memories of my father and me and is
                    valuable as a negative heritage is becoming a ghost town.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="keypoint">Solution:</span>
                    In collaboration with startups in charge of local businesses, we tried to convey the value of the
                    neighborhood
                    by attracting the attention of people in interested in local government and culture. We traveled
                    around
                    the old city with an analog camera and tried to leave a lasting impression onf each person.

                <p>
                    <span class="keypoint">Impact:</span>
                    In line with Korea's trend of Newtro's popularity, more and more people visited the area, more
                    magazines
                    and articles focused on the value of the neighborhood which was planned to be destroyed, and the
                    demolition was canceled.
                    Moreover, the road maintenance project which had been neglected and turning into a slum, was
                    completed.

                                area. But
                                now its
                                reputation is totally different from the past.

                    <p>
                        The history of Soje-dong traces back to the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945). At the
                        time,
                        an important
                        railroad connected the granaries of Gunsan to Seoul, and Soje-dong was created in the middle of
                        it
                        to be the
                        official management office/town. The area was previously occupied by a beautiful lake, “Sojeho
                        lake”
                        (소제호),
                        filled
                        by the Japanese army. The village developed into a prosperous area where many Japanese-style
                        houses
                        were built
                        as
                        the neighborhood grew. However, after the end of the Japanese colonial occupation, many of these
                        houses were
                        left
                        unattended, labelled of “Jeoksan houses” (적산가옥), negative heritage, and seen as a reminder of a
                        painful time. As
                        such, the rich village, where the Japanese army once lived, turned into an area where people
                        were
                        reluctant to
                        live
                        in. The local government announced a plan to rebuild the entire neighborhood and people left one
                        by
                        one. The
                        development plan never happened and the area turned into a slum.

                        For some, it is just a neighborhood, but I am personally connected to it. It is the place where
                        my
                        father had to
                        work from the young age of 14, due to poverty. He still hates that area. But to me, as a
                        20-year-old
                        with a
                        passion
                        for photography, Soje-dong was a diamond in the rough, and, despite my father’s disapproval, I
                        visited it three
                        times a week.

                        The Daejeon city government made various attempts to revigorate the neighborhood, such as
                        offering
                        artist
                        residencies, commissioning mural paintings, and trying to turn it into an attractive cultural
                        neighborhood. All
                        the
                        attempts failed, and urban redevelopment threatened once more the old village.

                    <p>
                        I did not want to let this town disappear. It was where I practiced photography since the first
                        time
                        I held a
                        camera
                        and the place that made me understand my usually silent father. I could not let this
                        neighborhood be
                        forgotten,
                        and
                        that is why I started this project.

                        I met with a startup CEO, who held local marketing events, and shared my ideas with him on how
                        to
                        show the true
                        value of Soje-dong. In collaboration with an event company, I designed a Silent Tour to promote
                        the
                        area. I
                        would
                        guide people wearing headphones, telling them the history of the village, opening up about my
                        father’s story,
                        playing nostalgic music, and reading poetry, while showing them all the secret views and hidden
                        gems
                        of
                        Soje-dong. I
                        became the docent and guardian of this old neighborhood.

                        We walked these streets where you can feel the weight of time and captured these anachronic
                        moments
                        with my film
                        camera. At the end of the tour, I would lead them to a local café located in an old bed and
                        breakfast from the
                        Japanese colonial time, reflecting on the experience and the new perspective on the
                        neighborhood.

                    <p>
                        These days, with the resurgent interest in vintage and retro-aesthetic, many turned their
                        attention
                        toward
                        Soje-dong
                        and what was left of its historical buildings. Unfortunately, this attention is superficial and
                        buildings have
                        been
                        indiscriminately turned into cafés and gifts shops without care, damaging the buildings with
                        condensation and
                        mold.
                        This newfound interest is propelled by private companies, not grass-root or local movements,
                        pushing
                        for
                        gentrification and short term-profit. Therefore, the neighborhood is endangered once again, as
                        it is
                        getting
                        squeezed of its value, and may turn back into a slum as trendy cafés already starts to closes as
                        fast as they
                        opened.

                        Soje-dong survives on a fine balance. From a complicated history, to governmental mismanagement
                        and
                        damaging
                        attention due to trends, how can we protect this neighborhood and coexist with the community?
